##  Design pattern ##

 Design patterns are standard solutions/technique to general problems that software developers faced during software development.

 Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides published a book titled Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software which initiated the concept of Design Pattern in Software development.In this book,there are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories:
 1. Creational
 These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case
 	1. Factory pattern 
 	2. Abstract Factory pattern 
 	3. Singleton pattern 
 	4. Prototype Pattern 
 	5. Builder pattern 
 	6. Object Pool Pattern 
 2. Structural
 These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
 	1. Adapter pattern 
 	2. Bridge pattern 
 	3. Filter pattern 
 	4. Composite Pattern 
 	5. Decorator pattern 
 	6. Facade Pattern  
 	7. Flyweight Pattern  
 	8. proxy Pattern  
 3. Behavioral patterns
 These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
 	1. chain of responsibility pattern 
 	2. Command pattern 
 	3. Interpreter pattern 
 	4. Iterator Pattern 
 	5. Mediator pattern
 	6. Observer pattern
 	7. State pattern
 	8. Null Object pattern
 	9. Strategy pattern
